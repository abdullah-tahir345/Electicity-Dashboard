# DevSoft Energy Consumption & Management Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for monitoring and analyzing DevSoft's energy consumption in Lahore. The dashboard offers detailed insights into daily and hourly power usage, differentiates between grid and genset consumption, tracks peak and off-peak loads, and provides a clear view of outage impacts and diesel reconciliation.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to empower DevSoft with actionable data to optimize energy usage, identify cost-saving opportunities, and enhance operational efficiency.

## Key Features

* **Daily & Hourly Consumption Analysis:** Track energy usage over time with detailed breakdowns.
* **Grid vs. Genset Performance:** Monitor power sourcing from both the main grid and backup generators.
* **Peak & Off-Peak Load Management:** Understand consumption patterns during different tariff periods.
* **Outage Impact Assessment:** Quantify the duration and impact of power interruptions.
* **Diesel Reconciliation:** Gain insights into genset fuel consumption and associated energy generation.
* **Weekday vs. Weekend Trends:** Analyze how consumption patterns vary throughout the week.
* **Drill-down Capabilities:** Explore granular data for deeper analysis (e.g., hourly voltage, current, power factor).

## Dashboard Pages Overview

The dashboard is organized into several pages, each designed to provide specific insights into DevSoft's energy data.

---

### 1. Summary

This page provides a high-level overview of daily energy consumption, showing total units consumed from both the DevSoft Grid and DevSoft Genset. It allows for quick visualization of overall consumption trends over a selected period.

### 2. Interval Data

The Interval Data page details the daily kWh units consumed, specifically breaking down the usage into Off-Peak and Peak consumption periods from the DevSoft Grid. It also presents current month (CM) and last month (LM) totals for quick comparison.

### 3. Detail

This page offers a granular, hourly-wise view of electrical parameters for a selected day. It displays real-time data for voltages (Va, Vb, Vc), current (Ia, Ib, Ic), power factor, and total power, allowing for in-depth analysis of electrical performance throughout the day.

### 4. Consumption Detail

The Consumption Detail page provides a daily breakdown of maximum demand time, maximum demand, total kWh units, and the split between off-peak and peak consumption. This page is crucial for understanding daily load characteristics and billing components.

### 5. Weekday & Weekend

This page visualizes the distribution of kWh consumption across weekdays and weekends. It helps identify patterns and variations in energy usage based on the day of the week, crucial for optimizing schedules and operations.

### 6. Outage

The Outage page tracks and displays "LS Hours" (Load Shedding/Loss of Supply Hours) by date and month. This provides clear visibility into power interruptions and their duration, aiding in understanding the reliability of grid supply.

### 7. Diesel Reconciliation

This page is dedicated to tracking genset performance and diesel consumption. It provides key metrics such as total diesel litres consumed, genset runtime (hours), and the corresponding energy units generated by the genset, facilitating reconciliation and cost analysis.

## Data Sources

The data for this dashboard is derived from detailed energy consumption logs, likely from smart meters or an energy monitoring system at DevSoft's Lahore facility. The data includes daily and hourly consumption, grid/genset usage, and specific electrical parameters.

## Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, transformation (Power Query), visualization, and dashboard creation.

## How to Use

To explore this dashboard:

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2.  Ensure you have **Power BI Desktop** installed.
3.  Open the `.pbix` file (e.g., `DevSoft_Energy_Dashboard.pbix`) using Power BI Desktop.
4.  Navigate through the different pages using the sidebar to view various aspects of energy consumption.
5.  Use the date slicers at the top right of each page to adjust the reporting period.
